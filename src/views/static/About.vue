        <p>In the era of tracking- and advertisement-heavy workout apps, this very basic solution provides an antithesis that you can use on any (modern) device with an up-to-date web browser.</p>
        <p>Even though it's not published on the Android or iOS app store, you can add this app to your phone's home screen by following <a href="https://natomasunified.org/kb/add-website-to-mobile-device-home-screen/" target="_blank">this guide</a>.</p>
        <p>It had originally been created in early 2019 and since then was iterated a couple of times by <a href="https://pascal.rocks" target="_blank" class="inline-link">Pascal Wengerter</a> and friends.</p>
        <p>The term <strong><i>mate</i></strong> doesn't assume a gender - it's borrowed from the Australian slang for "buddy". Any individual is invited to use this application.</p>
        <p>The source code for this application is open source and can be found <a href="https://github.com/pascalwengerter/musclemate-frontend" target="_blank" class="inline-link">on GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>Any feedback? Great, feel free to drop us a line at <a href="mailto:gainz@musclemate.app" target="_blank" class="inline-link">gainz@musclemate.app</a>.</p>
